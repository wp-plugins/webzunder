Improve the distribution of your website content easily by adding Open Graph information for Google and Facebook

== Description ==

By using the webZunder Open Graph Plugin, you can easily improve the presentation of your content in social networks like Google and Facebook and in search engine results. 

With the Plugin you can easily:

*   define a fallback description for pages and posts without a description
*   define a fallback image for pages and posts without an image
*   define an individual description and an individual image for your posts and pages 
*   connect your Google+ Business Page with your WordPress pages (Google publisher tag)
*   connect your Google+ User Profile with your WordPress articles. So your G+ avatar appears aside the search results (Google author tag)
*   connect your Facebook Business Page with your WordPress site (Facebook publisher tag)
*   create a summary twitter card for your posts

To avoid problems, we recommend to desist from parallel using other SEO-plugin which supports Open Graph meta tags, Google Authorship or twitter cards.
